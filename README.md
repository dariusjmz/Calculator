# Calculator
This is a basic calculator I decided to code as a beginner project on Python

# Supported Operations
You can add, subtract, divide and multiply, it supports both integers and floats, both positive and negative numbers as well

# Functions
"<---" is just a homemade backspace, "CE" clears the current number you're typing, "C" clears everything, including the current operation.

# My Personal Details
After selecting an operation, the number resets to 0 so you can type it from the beginning. Besides that, it's very simple and intuitive

Any recommendations to improve the logic or the GUI are very much appreciated.
